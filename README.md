# Face Expression Recognition Project

## Introduction
This project is a machine learning model designed for **face expression recognition**. It analyzes facial expressions from images and classifies them into different categories. The dataset used for training was downloaded from Kaggle using the `kagglehub` library. The model has achieved an accuracy of **75.29%**.

## How It Works
1. **Dataset Acquisition:**
   - The dataset, containing labeled facial expressions, was downloaded from Kaggle using the `kagglehub` library.
   - Link to dataset: [face expression recognition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset)
   
2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Images were resized, normalized, and augmented to enhance model performance.
   - Data cleaning was performed to remove any noisy or irrelevant samples.

3. **Model Training:**
   - A deep learning model was trained using frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used for feature extraction and classification.
   - The model was evaluated on a test dataset and achieved an accuracy of **75.29%**.

4. **Deployment & Usage:**
   - The trained model can classify new images into different facial expression categories.
   - It can be integrated into applications for real-time emotion detection.
